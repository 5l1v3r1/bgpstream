`pybgpstream` is a Python library that provides a high-level interface to an
archive of BGP routing information.

`pybgpstream` provides two Python modules:
 - `_pybgpstream`, a low-level (almost) direct interface to the C API of
   [libbgpstream](http://www.caida.org/~chiara/bgpstream-doc/bgpstream/index.html)
 - `pybgpstream`, a high-level 'Pythonic' interface to the functionality
   provided by `_pybgpstream` (this is a work in progress, will be released soon)


Please take a look at http://www.caida.org/~chiara/bgpstream-doc/pybgpstream/
to read the latest version of the documentation.
