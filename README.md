`pybgpstream` is a Python library that provides a high-level interface to an
archive of BGP routing information.

`pybgpstream` provides two Python modules:
 - `_pybgpstream`, a low-level (almost) direct interface to the C API of
   [libbgpstream](https://github.com/caida/bgpstream)
 - `pybgpstream`, a high-level 'Pythonic' interface to the functionality
   provided by `_pybgpstream`
