Introduction
========================

`pybgpstream` is a Python library that provides a high-level interface to an
archive of BGP routing information.

`pybgpstream` provides two Python modules:
 - :doc:`api__pybgpstream`, a low-level (almost) direct interface to the C API of
   `libbgpstream`_
 - :doc:`api_pybgpstream`, a high-level 'Pythonic' interface to the functionality
   provided by `libbgpstream`_
